Example 5: Iterative Feedback Learning System

This example demonstrates the new iterative feedback learning system that
significantly improves success rates for complex operations by learning
from failures and providing targeted feedback to the LLM.

Key features demonstrated:
- Enhanced validation with detailed error analysis
- Iterative learning within generation sessions
- Feedback-aware prompting with specific guidance
- Success pattern mining and knowledge base
